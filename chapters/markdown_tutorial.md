# Markdown tutorial
\label{cha:markdown_tutorial}

\noindent **Note**: This Markdown tutorial is currently in development.

Softcover supports a superset of John Gruber's original Markdown, including the [*kramdown*](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) extensions, [fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks), and embedded \LaTeX. Until this chapter is finished, please consult the following resources:

* The template files generated by `softcover new`, which have lots of examples of how to use the system

* The [source of this book](https://github.com/softcover/softcover_book), which is written mostly in Markdown

* The original [Markdown syntax reference](daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

* The [kramdown documentation](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html)
