\noindent \textbf{Note:} This \PolyTeX\ tutorial is currently in development.

\PolyTeX\ is a strict subset of the \LaTeX\ typesetting language. You can generate an example \PolyTeX\ book as follows:

%= lang:console
\begin{code}
$ softcover new --polytex example_polytex_book
\end{code}

\noindent Then refer to the following resources:

\begin{itemize}
\item The generated example book
\item The \href{https://github.com/softcover/softcover_book}{source of this book} (this chapter is written in \PolyTeX)
\item The \href{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}{Wikibooks LaTeX reference}
\end{itemize}

Because not all of \LaTeX\ is supported by Softcover, to learn \PolyTeX\ I recommend running a local server and trying out commands to see if they work:\footnote{Here we use the \kode{-p} flag to run the server on port 4001 in case another book is already running on port 4000 (the default).}

%= lang:console
\begin{code}
$ cd example_polytex_book
$ softcover server -p 4001
\end{code}

\noindent Visit \href{http://localhost:4001}{http://localhost:4001} to see the result. Then make changes, \href{http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rinse%20repeat}{rinse, and repeat}.
