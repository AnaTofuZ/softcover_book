\label{cha:polytex_tutorial}

\textbf{Note:} This \PolyTeX\ tutorial is currently in development. Until it's finished, you can get started with \PolyTeX\ as follows:

%= lang:console
\begin{code}
$ softcover new --polytex example_polytex_book
\end{code}

\noindent Then refer to the following resources:

\begin{itemize}
\item The generated example book
\item The \href{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX}{Wikibooks \LaTeX\ reference}
\end{itemize}

Of course, not all of \LaTeX\ is supported by Softcover, so to learn \PolyTeX\ I recommend running a local server and trying out commands to see if they work:\footnote{Here we use the \kode{-p} flag to run the server on port 4001 in case another book is already running on port 4000 (the default).}

%= lang:console
\begin{code}
$ softcover server -p 4001
\end{code}

\noindent Visit \href{http://localhost:4001}{http://localhost:4001} to see the result.
